# Overview
We present a novel geometric approach with a streamlined yet comprehensive representation of both surgical targets and instruments. It provides a more robust interaction representation with high-level semantics. We introduce an adaptive graph learning to obtain a dynamic understanding of surgical procedures. Additionally, we propose an adaptive multi-horizon learning strategy to offer global insights for each horizon and balance learning objectives across various time spans.
